# TCP-Chat-Room

## Introduction
This project implements a simple TCP-based chat room system in Java. It allows 
multiple clients to connect to a server and communicate with each other in real-time. 
The server is designed to handle multiple client connections concurrently using multithreading.

## Features
  * Client-Server Architecture: The system follows a client-server model where multiple clients can connect to a central server.
  * Text-Based Communication: Users can send text messages to the chat room, and all connected clients receive these messages in real-time.
  * Multithreading: The server is capable of handling multiple client connections concurrently using Java's multithreading capabilities.
  * Sockets: Communication between the server and clients is established using TCP sockets, ensuring reliable data transmission over the network.


## Requirements
  * Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
  * Basic understanding of Java programming
  * Knowledge of socket programming and multithreading concepts


## Configuration
  * Server Configuration: You can configure the server settings such as port number and maximum connections allowed by modifying the Server.java file.
  * Client Configuration: Client-side configurations can be adjusted in the Client.java file, including the server's IP address and port number.
